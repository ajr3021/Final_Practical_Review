Try to do this with only unit 1-5 stuff.
Once you have that solution, feel free to go
back and use things we learned in later topics
to improve the code.

Test files were provided for you to ensure that your code
was functioning properly, but I would strongly encourage
you to write your own tests before veiwing them, as 
it will certainly be something you are asked to do on 
the final.
