You need to create a quiz program.
In order to do this you need to create classes 
to present a question and an option.
Each question has a type, some number of options, and a correct answer.
Each option has a letter and text.

A question should be able to ask the user to input and option
and determine if that answer is correct.
You will also need a nice way to display questions to the user.

Be sure to also create getters and setter as needed.
